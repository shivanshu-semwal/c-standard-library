# C Standard Library

>The `C standard library` or `libc` is the standard library for the `C programming language`, as specified in the `ANSI C` standard. 


It was developed at the same time as the C library `POSIX` specification, which is a superset of it. Since ANSI C was adopted by the __International Organization for Standardization__, the C standard library is also called the `ISO C library`.


The C standard library provides `macros`, `type definitions` and `functions` for tasks such as __string handling__, __mathematical computations__, __input/output processing__, __memory management__, and several other operating system services.
